A * instead of a | next to an action means that the flow goes both ways.
A + instead of a | next to an action means that this will open in a new tab.
Multiple actions on a pipe imply options that go to the same state.
Any [action] on the middle of a pipe is the same as an action beside a pipe.
Any state denoted as {state} has its own subtree that is being abstracted in the current tree for simplicity.
