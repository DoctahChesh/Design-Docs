District 10 - (Post)Apocalyptic
The youngest of districts, forged from the destruction wrought upon the Lost District.


Governor
Mercutio Malache

There is very little information known about the "leader" of the various dystopian guilds, tribes and other ramshackle groups that make up District 10. He is rarely seen anywhere near the Axis Tower and, though he seems to be relatively nomadic, he has been known to take up residency in the mutated oasis that cropped up in the breach of the outer rim just before the appearance of the bordering Spokes’ rust and ash appeared. It’s no secret that this was also around the time the new pseudo governor appeared.
