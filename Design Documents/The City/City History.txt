The Beginning of the Twisted Hub
  
   Created by the Original 8 Governors.
   	Most likely because it was thought to be possibly profitable?

   Whale captured in the Shallows of Reality
        That caused the Bleed
  
   The City was built on the stream of the Bleed for some reason by the 8
    The Spokes contain and direct the bleed
	Possibly drawing some sort of power/resource towards the center/governors

   No connection remains to the 8’s worlds and the 8 Governors cannot leave the Hub.
